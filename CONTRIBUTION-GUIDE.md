# Contribution Guide

Firstly, i'm welcome every contribution which the way described as following:

Our package has a lot of work to do and most of them is testing rather than coding.

You can Contribute that package by following 2 ways:

### Testing

If you have a different windows, linux or especially macos distribution or version on either in a virtual machine or an actual machine, and if you want to make test that cli on that, You can simply fork, build project for that platform and run the tests and write the results of that test on "SUPPORTED-OS.md" file and make your contribution.

That contribution should be like this:

For Example, if you try to download rust on windows 8 with most up to date requirements and if that worked, you can add that record on below the "Rust" subtitle's "Windows" subtitle:

Windows 8 - &#10003;

If it isn't work, you can add that record:

Windows 8 - &#10060;

### Coding And Testing

If you want to also contribute codebase, with the condition of also testing you are welcome. If you're not tested that code, please don't contribute that code, we aren't need that for now. If you're tested, add a record on the below of related subtitles as described on "Testing" title. And make needed contribution on related codes.

It's also valid for making implementations for unimplemented sdk's. 

All contributions which fit to rules that mentioned above are welcome.
